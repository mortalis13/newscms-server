	(6, '2014-10-18 21:46:25', 'Metallica History', 'There is more to the band Metallica than most people know since they have never looked into the past to find the roots of Metallica. Metallica was formed in 1981. Metallica today consists of James Hetfield (guitar/vocals), Lars Ulrich (drums), Kirk Hammett (guitar), and Rob Trujillo (bass). However, in the past there have been many members of Metallica that were in the band in the first year. The past members of Metallica are Jason Newsted (bass), Cliff Burton (Bass), Ron McGovney (bass), Lloyd Grand (guitar), David Mustaine (guitar), and Jef Warner (guitar). Cliff and Jason were the only two members that were a part of the band for several years. Cliff joined Metallica about one year (1982) after Metallica was formed. Once cliff died (September 27th, 1986) Jason was chosen to be the new bass player. However, he has since quit the band and started his own. This allowed Rob to take his place. As you can see that there is a lot of history already. However, the history is just starting.\r\n\r\n<b>1981</b>\r\nLars Ulrich and James Hetfield both placed a separate add in the classified section of The Recycler. Both of them noticed that they were both looking for musicians to form a band. Nothing became of this first meeting. Lars then went to the UK for three months to follow Diamond Head around. When he returned, he secured a deal to record a track for a metal compilation tape called Metal Massacre. He quickly formed his band which was made of himself, James Hetfield, and Lloyd Grant.\r\n\r\n<b>1982</b>\r\n“In March…,” Hadland states that “Metallica played there first gig ever! At Radio City, in Anaheim, CA.” (1998) One month after the show, Metallica recorded a demo to obtain another show. The demo was never named but called Power Metal by the people that bootlegged the demo. Hit The Lights was the track chosen to be on the Metal Massacre compilation tape. Metal Massacre was released on June 14. The Power Metal demo and the Metal Massacre compilation did not get them anywhere in the business. Metallica would soon have to record a new demo.\r\nOn July 6 a new demo was recorded. This demo was called No Life `Till Leather was recorded with the following tracks: Hit the Lights, Mechanix, Motorbreath, Seek and Destroy, Metal Militia, Jump in The Fire, and Phantom Lord. Metallica’s relationship with the bass player started to get rocky. In August, Brian Slagel, owner of the Metal Blade Record Label which released Metal Massacre, informed Metallica of a bass player named Cliff Burton. After seeing Cliff play and the raw energy that he gave off, Metallica decided that this was the new bassist for them. Cliff did not want to move to L.A. and insisted that Metallica had to move to San Francisco. On September 18 Metallica played their first show in the Bay Area. As it turns out this is one of the most crucial points in the band. Metallica’s popularity grew dramatically and they had to play more shows in and around the Bay Area. \r\nOn November 29 Metallica played a show with a band named Exodus, which is where they met Kirk Hammett for the first time. This show was Dave’s first show with Metallica. On December 28 Cliff Burton joined Metallica. By now, Metallica s well known in the Bay Area and are trying to get known through out the country. \r\n\r\n<b>1983</b>\r\nIn January, Jonny Zazula invited Metallica to New York to play a number of shows. While in New York, Jonny Z. tried to get them a record contract but failed. Since he could not get them a record contract, Jonny founded his own recording label called Megaforce Records and signed Metallica as his first band. \r\nIn April, Lars, James, and Dave moved to San Francisco. After the move, Cliff Burton became a full member of Metallica. After the move, Metallica took Kirk to New York with them to record. On this little tour across the US, Dave was kicked out of Metallica. Later on, Kirk replaced Dave as lead guitar. In May, Metallica recorded their first album Kill `Em All. However, this was not the albums original name. The album was originally called Metal Up Your Ass however the record distributors refused to release and album with a profane name. The name Kill `Em All is actually a direct remark towards the distributors. Kill `Em All was released in July. A two month tour followed. After the tour the band started writing songs for their next album. \r\n\r\n<b>1984</b>\r\nThe album was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios. In June, Metallica released their second album entitled Ride The Lightning. The growth in their writing ability proved that they were worthy of signing by a major record label. By Fall of 1984, Metallica finished signing with Electra records.\r\n\r\n<b>1985</b>\r\nWhile on the tour in England for their second album, Metallica completely stole the show from the headlining band Bon Jovi at the Monsters of Rock Festival. In the fall, Metallica recorded their third album Master of Puppets.\r\n\r\n<b>1986</b>\r\nIn March, Master of Puppets was released. To promote their album, Metallica toured with Ozzy Osbourne. This tour is the last tour that Metallica is a supporting act due to the growth in their popularity. While on tour James Broke his arm in a skateboarding incident. Since James could not play, Kirk’s guitar roadie played while James sang. On September 27, Metallica was on their way to a concert in Europe. When the unthinkable happened. The driver lost control of the bus and wrecked. The bus ended up on its side lying in a ditch. Three members of the band, James, Lars, and Kirk, emerged from the bus with the rest of the crew. However, there was one member missing. Cliff died in the wreck. All James had to say was\r\n“I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, \'Don\'t fucking do that!\' I already wanted to kill the guy. I don\'t know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn\'t alive anymore." (James Hetfield, 1993)\r\nJason Newsted was the bass player chosen to replace cliff. Jason was a long time Metallica fan that had his dream come true. Jason played his first show on November 8.\r\n\r\n<b>1987-1995</b>\r\nCliff `Em All was released in 1987. This was a video so that Metallica could pay homage to Cliff and his family. In September of `83 Metallica released their next album …And Justice For All. This album hit number six on The Billboard 200. Metallica also made a music video for their song “One” which hit number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1989 Metallica was nominated for a Grammy award but did not win. Also in 1989, Metallica released their second video “Two of One.” In 1990 and 1991, Metallica won a Grammy for best Metal Performance. \r\nIn October of 1990, Metallica entered the studio to begin working on what would become their most popular selling album ever. The Album was released on August 12, 1991. Stores opened at 12:01 in the morning. After the release of their self titled album, also know as the black album, Metallica’s popularity soared to new heights. Metallica also made several singles and music videos from this album whish were all popular. While touring for the black album, James was severally burned by the pyrotechnics on August 9, 1992 in Montreal, Canada. At the time they were touring with Guns ‘n Roses. Axle Rose, who is the vocalist for Guns ‘n Roses, canceled the show because he could not upstage what happened. This caused a riot to break. The next shows were cancelled. In November, the two videos “A Year And A Half In The Life Of Metallica” were released. In 1993, Metallica started touring again. In 1994, Metallica played at Woodstock 1994.\r\n\r\n<b>1996-2003</b>\r\nIn 1996, Metallica was back in the studio recording there next album. Load, the next album, was released in July of 1996. In 1997 Metallica played a free show in Philadelphia and started the “Poor Touring Me” Tour. They also recorded and released the next Metallica album Reload. In 1998, the started the “Pour Re-Touring Me” Tour. In November of 1998, Metallica sued Amazon.com for selling the bootleg “Bay Area Thrashers: The Early Years” seeking damages and an injunction on future sales. In winter of 1998, Metallica released Garage Inc. which was recordings of Metallica covering other bands material. In January of 1999, Metallica sued Victoria’s Secret for selling lip pencils that say Metallica which is a copyright infringement. In April of 1999, Metallica started the world tour for Garage Inc. They also played and recorded with the San Francisco Orchestra in April. In July, Metallica played at Woodstock 1999. In November of 1999, Metallica released there album with the symphony called S&M. In April of 2000, Metallica sued Napster, a well known peer to peer file sharing company, for copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and violations of the Racketeering Influenced & Corrupt organizations Act. \r\nIn June of 2000, Metallica started touring again on the Summer Sanitarium 2000 Tour. In July of the tour, a man fell to his death in Baltimore. In January of 2001, Jason Newstead left Metallica. In April, Metallica started work on there new album which was set to release later that year. However, the Album was pushed back several times until recently. IN July of 2001, the Napster case has finally been settled. The new album would not be worked on due to James checking himself into rehabilitation for alcoholism. This is not surprising since in the early days they were also known as Alcoholica. Metallica returned to the studio in Late 2002 to finish work on the awaited album and to find a replacement bass player. Once finished recording, Metallica held auditions for a bass player. In the end, Rob was chosen over the others. The new album is called St. Anger and was released on June 5, 2003. The album was out for only a month and had already sold over one million copies. Metallica Also started the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003.\r\nOver these years Metallica has become a very successful and memorable band. They have touched the hearts and souls of millions world wide. Metallica has been nominated and won many Grammies and awards. There popularity continues to grow with the continuing rock music scene. Although they have had many incidents that many bands would not be able to bounce back from, they are still around and more popular than ever. As for the future, they will continue to be a memorable and cherished band.\r\n', 'images/news/0e07ae7cf42b.jpg', 'roman', 0),

	(8, '2014-10-12 23:47:54', 'Metallica History 2', 'Early years (1981–1983)\r\nThe classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases. It was also used on their ninth studio album Death Magnetic (2008) and on Guitar Hero: Metallica, albeit in a slightly more slanting form.\r\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper—The Recycler—which read "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden." Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label\'s upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar. The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.\r\nUlrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich used Metallica for the name of his band. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered, and after seeing his expensive guitar equipment, Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo. Released on June 14, 1982, early pressings of Metal Massacre I listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica". Although angered by the error, Metallica managed to create enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana\'s early business cards in early 1982. In the fall of 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton\'s use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney out as they thought that he "didn\'t contribute anything, he just followed." Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica\'s first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).\r\nMetallica was ready to record its debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the additional cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life \'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record\'s recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.\r\n\r\nKill \'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983–1984)\r\nIn May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, with production duties handled by Paul Curcio. Band members decided to kick Mustaine out of the band due to drug and alcohol abuse and violent behavior just prior to the sessions on April 11, 1983. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett flew in to replace Mustaine the same afternoon.\r\nMustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews. He said Hammett "stole my job." Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing the guitar leads that Mustaine wrote. In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine slammed Hammett saying, "it\'s real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I\'d played on that No Life \'til Leather tape and got voted No. 1 guitarist in your magazine." On Megadeth\'s debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill \'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar. Metallica\'s first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983 at the nightclub The Showplace in Dover, New Jersey.\r\nThe band\'s debut studio album was initially going to be titled Metal Up Your Ass. Due to conflicts with its record label and the distributors\' refusal to release an album with that name, it was renamed Kill \'Em All. Released on Megaforce Records in the United States and Music for Nations in Europe, the album peaked at number 120 on the Billboard 200 in 1988, and although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene. The band embarked on the Kill \'Em All for One tour with Raven to support the release. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, where the band performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.\r\nMetallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. Released in August 1984, the album reached number 100 on the Billboard 200. A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors\' items. Other songs on the album include "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Fade to Black", "Creeping Death" (which tells the biblical story of the Hebrews\' exodus from slavery in Egypt, focusing on the final plague that was visited on the Egyptians), and the instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".\r\n\r\nMaster of Puppets (1984–1986)\r\nElektra Records A&R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a September 1984 Metallica concert. Impressed with what they saw, they signed Metallica to Elektra Records and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management. Metallica\'s burgeoning success was such that the band\'s British label Music for Nations released a limited edition "Creeping Death" single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the United States. Two of the three songs on the record (cover versions of Diamond Head\'s "Am I Evil?", and Blitzkrieg\'s "Blitzkrieg") appeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill \'Em All. Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S. marked a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and Armored Saint supporting. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt at Donington Park in England, playing in front of 70,000 people. A show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival saw the band play in front of a crowd of 60,000.\r\nMetallica\'s third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200, and spent 72 weeks on the chart. The album was the band\'s first to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003. Steve Huey of Allmusic considered the album "the band\'s greatest achievement". Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne for a United States tour. Hetfield broke his wrist skateboarding down a hill and continued the tour performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.\r\n\r\nBurton\'s death and Garage Days Re-Revisited (1986–1987)\r\nOn September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica\'s Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to see which bunk of the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett\'s bunk. Around dawn near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to flip several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and was killed. Hetfield recalls, "I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, \'Don\'t fucking do that!\' I already wanted to kill the . I don\'t know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn\'t alive anymore." Burton\'s death left Metallica\'s future in doubt. The three remaining members decided that Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family\'s blessings, the band sought a replacement.\r\nRoughly 40 people tried out for auditions including Hammett\'s childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam. Newsted learned Metallica\'s entire setlist, and after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy\'s Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided that Newsted was the one to replace Burton, and Newsted\'s first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members took it on themselves to "initiate" Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.\r\nAfter Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space (dubbed "the Metalli-mansion", a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker) and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, North of San Francisco.\r\nMetallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield broke his wrist a second time skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel a Saturday Night Live appearance. In August 1987 an all-covers extended play titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The extended play was recorded in an effort to utilize the band\'s newly constructed recording studio, test out the talents of Newsted, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff \'Em All was released in 1987 commemorating Burton\'s three years in Metallica. Footage included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.\r\n\r\n...And Justice for All (1988–1990)\r\n...And Justice for All, the band\'s first studio album since Burton\'s death, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, the band\'s first album to enter the top 10. The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release. Newsted\'s bass was purposely turned down on the album as a part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored (however, he did receive writing credit on the track "Blackened"). There were complaints with the production; namely, Steve Huey of Allmusic noted Ulrich\'s drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly". The Damaged Justice tour followed to promote the album.\r\nIn 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All, in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win; however, the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave. The result generated controversy among fans and the press, as Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony as he was expecting Metallica to win. The award was named in Entertainment Weekly\'s "Grammy\'s 10 Biggest Upsets".\r\nFollowing the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One". The band performed the song in an abandoned warehouse, and footage was remixed with the film, Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV, with the alternate performance-only version held back in the event that MTV banned the remix version. MTV accepted the remix version, and the video was viewers\' first exposure to Metallica. It was voted number 38 in 1999 when MTV aired its "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown, and was featured in the network\'s 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMetallica (1990–1993)\r\nIn October 1990, Metallica entered One on One studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with the bands such as Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and Mötley Crüe, was hired as the producer. Metallica (also known as The Black Album) was remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages. Although the release was stalled until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the United States during its first week. The album was responsible for bringing Metallica to the attention of the mainstream and has been certified 15 times platinum in the United States, which makes it the 25th best-selling album in the country. The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. Dubbed the Wherever We May Roam Tour, it lasted 14 months and included dates in the United States, Japan, and the UK. In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performing a three-song set. Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.\r\nOn August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N\' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour with Guns N\' Roses, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There was confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted with Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7 m) flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted recalls that Hetfield\'s skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger". Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour as Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. The band\'s first box set was released in November 1993 called Live Shit: Binge & Purge. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.\r\n\r\nLoad, ReLoad, Garage Inc., and S&M (1994–1999)\r\nAfter almost three years of touring to support Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock \'94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1994 and played three outdoor shows which included headlining Donington Park in the United Kingdom, supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash\'s Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio \'95. The band spent roughly one year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts, marking the band\'s second number one. The cover of Load was created by Andres Serrano, and was called Blood and Semen III. Serrano pressed a mixture of his own semen and bovine blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in musical direction for the band and a new image with band members receiving haircuts. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in the summer of 1996.\r\nDuring early production of the album, the band had produced enough material for a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, ReLoad. The cover was created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. ReLoad debuted number one on the Billboard 200, and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield noted in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that some of the songs on these albums were initially thought by the band to be of average quality, and were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable. To promote ReLoad, Metallica performed on NBC\'s Saturday Night Live in December 1997, performing "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull.\r\nIn 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by bands such as Diamond Head, Killing Joke, The Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, and Black Sabbath. The second disc featured the original The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors\' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.\r\nOn April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters", approached the band in 1991 with the idea of pairing Metallica\'s music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.\r\n\r\nNapster controversy (2000–2001)\r\nIn 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band\'s entire catalogue was freely available. Legal action was initiated against Napster with Metallica filing a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\r\nThough the lawsuit named three universities for copyright infringement, the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Indiana University, no individuals were named. Yale and Indiana complied and blocked the service from its campuses, and Metallica withdrew the universities\' inclusion in the lawsuit. USC, however, had a meeting with students to decide what was going to happen with Napster. School administrators wanted it banned as its usage accounted for 40% of the bandwidth not being used for educational purposes.\r\nMetallica hired online consulting firm NetPD to monitor the Napster service for a weekend. A list of 335,435 Napster users who were believed to be sharing Metallica\'s music was compiled, and the 60,000-page document was delivered to Napster\'s office as Metallica requested the users be banned from the service. The users were banned, and rap artist Dr. Dre joined the lawsuit against Napster, which resulted in an additional 230,142 Napster users banned.\r\nUlrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site place a filter on the program in 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement was reached between Metallica and Napster when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest to purchase the rights to Napster for $94 million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. However, on June 3, 2002 Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.\r\nAt the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared in a skit with host Marlon Wayans that blasted the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student sitting in his dorm room listening to Metallica\'s "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. On receiving Wayans\' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing", Ulrich retorted that Marlon\'s idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking." He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans\' belongings, leaving him almost nude in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I\'ll buy one of my own." Ulrich was booed on stage later at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink 182.\r\n\r\nNewsted\'s departure and St. Anger (2001–2005)\r\nAs plans were being made to enter the recording studio, Newsted left the band on January 17, 2001. His statement revealed his departure was based on "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love." During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted revealed intentions he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was against the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica" and a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way". Newsted countered his statement by saying Hetfield recorded vocals for a song in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, and appears on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn\'t on those records. And I\'m not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"\r\nIn April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the next studio album. Over two years, more than 1,000 hours of footage was recorded. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab due to "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hiatus and the band\'s future was in doubt. Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002, though Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day, noon to 4 pm, and spend the rest of his time with his family. The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary, Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted described his former bandmates\' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own as "really fucking lame and weak".\r\nFor the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass, both on the album and for the few live shows at which Metallica performed during that time frame. Once the record was completed, in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted\'s permanent replacement. Bassists that auditioned included Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse. Following three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne\'s band, was chosen as the new bassist. As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo\'s replacement in Osbourne\'s band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod as part of the touring bill.\r\nIn June 2003, Metallica\'s eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich\'s "steely" sounding snare drum, and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism. Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net commented that "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don\'t propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing", and Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess". However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band\'s Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking". The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004, and was used as the official theme song for WWE\'s SummerSlam 2003.\r\nBefore the band\'s set at the 2004 Download Festival in England, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure, and was unable to perform. Hetfield searched for volunteers at the last minute to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo, and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed the songs "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich\'s drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", with Jordison performing the remainder of the set. Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rockers Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. However, for two shows on November 13, 2005, and November 15, 2005, Metallica opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&T Park in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nDeath Magnetic (2006–2011)\r\nIn December 2006, Metallica released a DVD containing all the music videos from 1989 to 2004. The DVD, titled The Videos 1989–2004, sold 28,000 copies in its first week, and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three. Metallica recorded a cover of Ennio Morricone\'s "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, released in February 2007. The cover received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance". A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played as the introduction for Metallica performances since the 1980s. However, this new version features the band itself performing the piece, giving a new guitar-based interpretation to the music.\r\nIn 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing Metallica\'s next studio album. The band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin. Metallica scheduled the release date for Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album\'s first single "The Day That Never Comes".\r\nOn September 2, 2008, a French record store began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks ahead of its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band\'s United Kingdom distributor, Vertigo Records, to officially release the album two days ahead of schedule, on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking any legal action against the retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich made such responses to the leak as, "...We\'re ten days from release. I mean, from here, we\'re golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me," and, "By 2008 standards, that\'s a victory. If you\'d told me six months ago that our record wouldn\'t leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."\r\nDeath Magnetic debuted at number one in the United States selling 490,000 units with Metallica becoming the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200. After a week of its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200, the European album chart, and became the fastest selling album in Australia for 2008.\r\nDeath Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists, along with Jack Johnson with the release of the album Sleep Through the Static, to remain on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic had also remained at number one on Billboard\'s Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. Internationally, the album reached number one in 32 countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\r\nIn November 2008, Metallica came to the end of its record deal with Warner Bros., and the band is now considering its options for the future and, according to Ulrich, one of the band\'s options is to release its next album through the internet.\r\nOn January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009, and that former bassist Jason Newsted (who left the band in 2001), would perform with the band at the ceremony. Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed, and that bassist Trujillo had agreed not to play, as he "wanted to see the Black Album band". However, during the band\'s set of "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage. Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica also invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined however, citing his touring commitments in Europe.\r\nMetallica, along with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010 at Bemowo Airport (Warsaw, Poland). It was the first performance of that bands played as a part of Sonisphere Festival series, one of the following (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas. They also went on to play in Bucharest, Romania (June 26, 2010) and then in Istanbul, Turkey (June 27, 2010) also as part of the Sonisphere Festival. On June 28, 2010, Death Magnetic was certified 2X platinum by the RIAA.\r\nThe band\'s World Magnetic Tour ended on November 21, 2010 in Melbourne, Australia. The band had been touring for over two years in support of Death Magnetic. To go with its final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live limited edition EP of past performances in Australia was released called Six Feet Down Under. The EP was also followed by Six Feet Down Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010. Part 2 contains a further 8 songs recorded during the first two Oceanic Legs of the World Magnetic Tour.\r\nOn November 26, 2010, Metallica released another live EP, titled Live at Grimey\'s, which was recorded in June 2008 at Grimey\'s Record Store, just prior to its appearance at Bonnaroo that year.\r\nIn a June 2009 interview with Italy\'s Rock TV, Ulrich stated that Metallica was planning to continue touring through August 2010, stating there were no plans for a tenth album, but was sure that they would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band may start thinking about recording their next album in the second half of 2011. In a November 2010 interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich stated that Metallica wants to get back to writing again for 2011. Ulrich stated: "There’s a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven’t really written since, what, ’06, ’07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I’d say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, bassist Robert Trujillo said that Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as the producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There\'s no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He also added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you\'re kind of testing the water. Now that we\'re comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record – it\'s my hero – it\'s a great team. And it\'s only gonna better; I really believe that. So I\'m super-excited." In June 2011, it was announced by Rubin that Metallica had begun writing their new album.\r\nOn November 9, 2010, Metallica announced that it would be headlining the Rock in Rio, in Rio de Janeiro, on September 25, 2011. On December 13, 2010, the band announced that it would once again play as part of the "big four" during the Sonisphere Festival U.K., on July 8, 2011. It was the first time all of the "big four" members played on the same stage in the United Kingdom. The performance took place at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire. On December 17, 2010, Another "big four" Sonisphere performance was announced that would take place in France on July 9. On January 25, 2011, another "big four" performance was announced in the United States. It took place on April 23, 2011 in Indio, California at the Empire Polo Club. It was the only scheduled concert in the United States, it was also the first time all of the "big four" members played on the same stage in the United States. On February 17, 2011, another show was announced in Europe. The performance took place in Gelsenkirchen, Germany on July 2, 2011. On February 22, another "big four" show was announced, also in Europe. It took place in Milan, Italy on July 6, 2011. On March 2, 2011, again another "big four" concert was announced, which took place in Gothenburg, Sweden on July 3, 2011 at the Ullevi Stadion.\r\n\r\nLulu and tenth studio album (2011–present)\r\nOn June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind\'s "Lulu" plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora\'s Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times, with Lars Ulrich later Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight".\r\nOn October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We\'ve been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we\'re going to be recording during the most of next year."\r\nMetallica were due to make their first appearance in India at the "India Rocks" concert, supporting the 2011 Indian Grand Prix. However, the concert was cancelled when the venue was proven unsafe. Fans raided the stage during the event and the organizers were later arrested for fraud. Metallica later made their Indian debut in Bangalore on October 30, 2011. On November 10, it was announced that Metallica would play at the Download Festival at Donington Park, England, headlining the main stage on Saturday June 9, 2012, and that they would be playing the The Black Album in its entirety.\r\nIn December 2011, Metallica began releasing songs online that were written for Death Magnetic, but were not present on the final album. On December 13, 2011 they were released on Beyond Magnetic, a digital EP release only on iTunes. It was later released on CD in January 2012.\r\nAlso in December Metallica celebrated its 30-year anniversary by playing 4 shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco. The shows were exclusive only to Met Club members and tickets were only being charged at $6 (or 19.81 for all 4 nights). The shows consisted of songs spanning their entire career and guest appearances by multiple artist that either helped or influenced Metallica. These shows were notable for having Dave Mustaine, Jason Newsted, Glenn Danzig, Ozzy Osbourne, Jerry Cantrell, Apocalyptica, members of Diamond Head, King Diamond among others join Metallica on stage for all appropriate songs.\r\nOn February 7, 2012, Metallica announced that they were going to start a new music festival called Orion Music + More, which took place on June 23 and 24, 2012 in Atlantic City. Metallica also confirmed that they would also headline the festival on both days and would perform two of their most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: their 1991 eponymous fifth release (The Black Album) on one night and 1984\'s Ride the Lightning the other. In a July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Lars Ulrich revealed that Metallica would not release their new album until at least early 2014.\r\nIn November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched their independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce all future releases from the band. They have acquired the rights to all of their studio albums, which will be reissued through this new label. Blackened releases will be distributed through Warner subsidiary Rhino Records in the United States, and Universal Music internationally. On September 20, Metallica announced via their official website that a new DVD containing footage of shows in Quebec 2009 would be released in December 2012 and fans would get the chance to vote for two setlists that would make it on to the final DVD. The film, titled Quebec Magnetic, will be released in the US on December 10, 2012.\r\n\r\n', 'images/news/9f23d356cf1a.jpg', 'roman', 0),
